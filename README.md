# PMF semantic markup specification

Repository for the Password-Manager Friendly (PMF) semantic markup
specification.

PMF semantic markup is a set of HTML class names and hidden elements that make
web pages easier for password managers to parse and interact with. PMF semantic
class names designate the meaning and purpose of human-readable forms and other
elements, while a small number of additional hidden elements supply useful
information that is not normally be available to a password manager.

See [pmfriendly.org][1] for more information about PMF.
